# Building a very simple Aggregate
This tutorial is here to help you with modelling a very simple 
domain. This will show how these helpers are usefull and will
speed up development.

## Table of contents
- Our simple User domain
- Creating our first commands
- Creating our first event
- Creating our AggregateRoot
- Connecting the dots.
- Time to unittest.

In the next tutorial we are going to improve the model because obviously
we can't leave personal data stored plain in our eventstore. 
We're going to tackle this by applying Crypto Schredding!
